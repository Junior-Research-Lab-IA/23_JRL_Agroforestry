# Variations in phenotypes and reproductive allometry of durum wheat in Mediterranean agroforestry

## Hypothesis
In an agroforestry system, sunlight interception by the understory or alley crop is reduced by the shading effect of the tree species. For instance, pearl millet grown in the alley of Leucaena leucocephala (L. leucocephala) hedgerow was found to intercept only 40% or 75% of the sunlight intercepted by sole millet crops (Monteith et al., 1991). Similarly, they have also assumed that the number of foliage in alley crops were lower than the sole stand millet due to interspecific competition for light resulting in lower light interception by alley crops.
